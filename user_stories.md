#BusMall MVP#

*Identify the functionality and design of the BusMall catalog by considering the interests and motivations of the following project contributors:

##Marking Research Team##

**As marketing professionals, we are seeking information gleaned from the feedback of individuals in focus groups presented with visuals of potential products BusMall is considering offering for purchase in a catalog format
***Client considerations: catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures; therefore the purpose of this research is to limit the number of items featured in the catalog to those which are most likely to sell
****From this process, our team will be able utilize a visual display of feedback data generated by the app to inform the marketing decisions before launching manufacturing of the final product
***In order to test the interest of BusMall's target audience and see which of the offerings they would be most likely to purchase, we will offer parameters to developers about not only how the products should be presented to research participants, but also how the resulting feedback data should be calculated and stored for later analysis by our team
****Target audience: Puget Sound regional transit system bus riders seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of increased commute times
****We are interested not only in the total number of clicks made by participants, but also the percentage of times that a potential product was clicked when it was shown


##Developers##

**As developers, we want to build an app that displays appealing visuals of potential products to individuals in focus groups who are to provide feedback for marketing research
***The presentation will feature three items at a time, side-by-side-by-side, from which the participants can choose which potential product they would be most likely to purchase
****Functional considerations:
*****The resulting data must be stored, calculated, and visually displayed for analysis by the marketing research team
*****To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, no results may be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made
*****Because the marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown, how many times each image is displayed must be tracked and calculated; this will ultimately be displayed in a graph to inform marketing decisions before the manufacturing process begins
*****The look and feel of the app is important; it must not only be functional for use by the marketing team, but also designed with custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML, etc. to further the appeal of the BusMall brand

##Focus Group Participants##

**As marketing research participants, we want to interact with an app that presents potential products in not only an appealing format that follows sound design principles, but also in a functionally fluid, user-friendly fashion
***Simplicity is valuable; an overcomplicated or overwhelming presentation of potential products would make it difficult to make our considerations carefully
***Based on our beliefs and experiences, we hope to provide valuable feedback to the business about which of their products are most likely to sell and why
